[[file:data_key.org][Table]] of afs master data locations.

Ignore slopes until we know if they are percents or angles.

* Datasets
  - abba15ex are just a few extension growths collected this year.
  - birchmas* are destructive files
  - elevmas12
    Just has elevations - already have all this info, but maybe double-check
  - demomas11 is just demo plot stuff (probably ignore this)
  - firmasv* destructive for fir
  - hhcht15mas (ignore)
  - hhtr15ht -> tallest ~5 trees in each plot
  - prism data: 3 samples for each segment (different for different years),
    weird stuff in 1988
  - seesapmas11: complex sampling all from segments
    - TAG is identifier
    - SUB columns for substrate
  - soilmas11: soil probe data for HH transects and segments (no permanent plots)
  - trseedmas11: high high for seedlings
  - trspcovmas11: percent cover (2 kinds-donut, 1x1) by species/year for HH only
    
* Substrate
  - Three datasets: permanent, segments, high high
  - permanent/segments give low/med info

** datasets
  - ppsubmas10c -> substrate data for permanent plots (1x1)
  - trsubmas11c -> same for transects
  - seesapmas11 has substrate for segments
  
* Missing
  - herb/shrub percent cover files (below HH, ie. permanent plots and segments)
